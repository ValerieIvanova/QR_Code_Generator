# QR_Code_Generator
This script is a simple QR code generator that uses the Tkinter library for the GUI and the pyqrcode library to generate the QR code. The user is prompted to enter some text or a URL in an entry field and then press the "Generate QR code" button to create the QR code. The script then opens a file dialog for the user to choose a location to save the QR code image file, which is in PNG format. After the image is saved, the script displays the image and a message indicating the file path of the saved image. The script also has a background image and uses a message box to display a warning if the user tries to generate a QR code without entering any text or URL.
